   1. Desktop mockup illustration correspond to Bootstrap `lg`-based classes &#10003;
   2. Tablet mockup illustration correspond to Bootstrap `md`-based classes &#10003; 
   3. Mobile mockup illustration correspond to Bootstrap `sm`-based classes &#10003;

8. Navbar: Create a navbar that scrolls away together with the page &#10003;

10. The `navbar` has a company name (i.e., `navbar-brand` class) called "Food, LLC" that is aligned to the left side of the `navbar` &#10003;

11. For desktop and tablet view, the `navbar` does not contain anything else (no other buttons visible) &#10003;

12. Navbar - Mobile View:
    1. Create a simple menu button (3 horizontal bars) &#10003;
    2. When the user clicks that button, a `dropdown` menu appears &#10003;

    4. The `dropdown` takes up the entire width of the browser window &#10003;
    5. The `dropdown` menu has a `background-color` that distinguishes it from the rest of the content &#10003;

13. Page Heading:
    1. The page heading (Our Menu) is centered within the browser window &#10003; 
    2. Use Bootstrap class to `center` the page heading &#10003;
    
14. Element with a `class='container'` or `class='container-fluid'` wrapping the grid &#10003;

2. Each section contains some text &#10003;

3. Set a `background-color` to distinguish the sections from the rest of the content &#10003;

4. How the sections are laid out on the screen depends on the width of the browser window:
   1. Each section is tall (lot of content text or height property set to something like `700px`) &#10003;

5. Each section has a `h3`-based section heading &#10003;

6. The `h3` is centered within the section (with the same Bootstrap class used for centering the page) &#10003;

7. Use the heading names shown in the mockup illustrations, i.e., "Chicken", "Beef", "Sushi" &#10003;

8. Desktop view:
   1. Each of the 3 sections take up the same amount of space on the screen &#10003;
   
9. Tablet view:

   2. The 3rd section is in the second row and takes up the entire row by itself &#10003;
   
10. Mobile view:
    1. Each section takes up the entire row &#10003;
    2. At the end of each section, there is a link that says "Back to Top" &#10003;
    3. The link jumps the page back to "Our Menu" heading &#10003;
    
11. The menu items "Chicken", "Beef", "Sushi" are linked to jump to the corresponding sections (mobile-only menu `dropdown`) &#10003;

12. The `dropdown` action button must have different colors when open or closed, respectively &#10003;
